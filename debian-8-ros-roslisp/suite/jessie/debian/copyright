 Lisp Lesser General Public License
 .
 Preamble to the Gnu Lesser General Public License
 .
 Copyright (c) 2000 Franz Incorporated, Berkeley, CA 94704
 .
 The concept of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
 ("LGPL") has been adopted to govern the use and distribution of
 above-mentioned application. However, the LGPL uses terminology that
 is more appropriate for a program written in C than one written in
 Lisp. Nevertheless, the LGPL can still be applied to a Lisp program
 if certain clarifications are made. This document details those
 clarifications. Accordingly, the license for the open-source Lisp
 applications consists of this document plus the LGPL. Wherever there
 is a conflict between this document and the LGPL, this document takes
 precedence over the LGPL.
 . 
 A "Library" in Lisp is a collection of Lisp functions, data and
 foreign modules. The form of the Library can be Lisp source code (for
 processing by an interpreter) or object code (usually the result of
 compilation of source code or built with some other
 mechanisms). Foreign modules are object code in a form that can be
 linked into a Lisp executable. When we speak of functions we do so in
 the most general way to include, in addition, methods and unnamed
 functions. Lisp "data" is also a general term that includes the data
 structures resulting from defining Lisp classes. A Lisp application
 may include the same set of Lisp objects as does a Library, but this
 does not mean that the application is necessarily a "work based on
 the Library" it contains.
 .
 The Library consists of everything in the distribution file set
 before any modifications are made to the files. If any of the
 functions or classes in the Library are redefined in other files,
 then those redefinitions ARE considered a work based on the
 Library. If additional methods are added to generic functions in the
 Library, those additional methods are NOT considered a work based on
 the Library. If Library classes are subclassed, these subclasses are
 NOT considered a work based on the Library. If the Library is
 modified to explicitly call other functions that are neither part of
 Lisp itself nor an available add-on module to Lisp, then the
 functions called by the modified Library ARE considered a work based
 on the Library. The goal is to ensure that the Library will compile
 and run without getting undefined function errors.
 .
 It is permitted to add proprietary source code to the Library, but it
 must be done in a way such that the Library will still run without
 that proprietary code present. Section 5 of the LGPL distinguishes
 between the case of a library being dynamically linked at runtime and
 one being statically linked at build time. Section 5 of the LGPL
 states that the former results in an executable that is a "work that
 uses the Library." Section 5 of the LGPL states that the latter
 results in one that is a "derivative of the Library", which is
 therefore covered by the LGPL. Since Lisp only offers one choice,
 which is to link the Library into an executable at build time, we
 declare that, for the purpose applying the LGPL to the Library, an
 executable that results from linking a "work that uses the Library"
 with the Library is considered a "work that uses the Library" and is
 therefore NOT covered by the LGPL.
 .
 Because of this declaration, section 6 of LGPL is not applicable to
 the Library. However, in connection with each distribution of this
 executable, you must also deliver, in accordance with the terms and
 conditions of the LGPL, the source code of Library (or your
 derivative thereof) that is incorporated into this executable.
