Description: Robot OS tf transform library to keep track of multiple coordinate frames
 tf is a package that lets the user keep track of multiple coordinate frames
 over time. tf maintains the relationship between coordinate frames in a tree
 structure buffered in time, and lets the user transform points, vectors, etc
 between any two coordinate frames at any desired point in time.
 .
 This package contains the library itself.

Description: Set of utilities to operate with the Robot OS tf lib
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS), and contains transform
 library tools. Although tf is mainly a code library meant to be used
 within ROS nodes, it comes with a large set of command-line tools
 that assist in the debugging and creation of tf coordinate
 frames. These tools include: static_transform_publisher,
 tf_change_notifier, tf_echo, tf_empty_listener tf_monitor, tf_remap
 and view_frames_tf

Description: Robot OS tf transform library -- LISP interface
 tf is a package that lets the user keep track of multiple coordinate frames
 over time. tf maintains the relationship between coordinate frames in a tree
 structure buffered in time, and lets the user transform points, vectors, etc
 between any two coordinate frames at any desired point in time.
 .
 This package contains the LISP bindings (messages and services) and
 is part of Robot OS (ROS).

Package: libtf-conversions0d
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, libtf0d ( = ${binary:Version}),
Multi-Arch: same
Description: Robot OS conversion library between tf and Eigen and KDL
 This package contains a set of conversion functions to convert
 common tf datatypes (point, vector, pose, etc) into semantically
 identical datatypes used by other libraries. The conversion functions
 make it easier for users of the transform library (tf) to work with
 the datatype of their choice. Currently this package has support for
 the Kinematics and Dynamics Library (KDL) and the Eigen matrix library.
 .
 This package contains the library itself and is part of Robot OS (ROS).
