Description: Robot OS Python bindings for QT
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). It provides Python bindings
 for Qt. There are two providers: pyside and pyqt.  PySide is released
 under the LGPL.  PyQt is released under the GPL.
 .
 Both the bindings and tools to build bindings are included from each
 available provider.  For PySide, it is called "Shiboken".  For PyQt,
 this is called "SIP".
 .
 Also provided is adapter code to make the user's Python code
 independent of which binding provider was actually used which makes
 it very easy to switch between these.
