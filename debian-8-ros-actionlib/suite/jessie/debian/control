Description: Robot OS actionlib library
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). The actionlib stack provides
 a standardized interface for interfacing with preemptable
 tasks. Examples of this include moving the base to a target location,
 performing a laser scan and returning the resulting point cloud,
 detecting the handle of a door, etc. 
 .
 This package contains the library itself.
