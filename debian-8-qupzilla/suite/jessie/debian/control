Description: lightweight web browser based on libqtwebkit
 QupZilla is a new and very fast QtWebKit browser. It aims to be a
 lightweight web browser available through all major platforms. This
 project has been originally started only for educational
 purposes. But from its start, QupZilla has grown into a feature-rich
 browser.
 .
 QupZilla has all standard functions you expect from a web browser. It
 includes bookmarks, history (both also in sidebar) and tabs. Above
 that, you can manage RSS feeds with an included RSS reader, block ads
 with a builtin AdBlock plugin, block Flash content with Click2Flash
 and edit the local CA Certificates database with an SSL Manager.
 .
 QupZilla's main aim is to be a very fast and very stable QtWebKit
 browser available to everyone.
