Comment:
 Some of the files include different license information.
 However, according to an email from one of the core developers at the
 assimp-discussions mailinglist at sourceforge, this information is outdated
 and "all of Assimp is 3-clause BSD with the unfortunate exception of
 ./test/models-nonbsd."
 http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=27966437
 ./test/models-nonbsd/ has been excluded from the debian source package

 list of conditions in documentation and/or other materials provided with
 the distribution. Additional documentation is not needed for executables
 where a command line license option provides these and a note regarding

 "WiZ" or "MacZip" without the explicit permission of Info-ZIP. Such
 altered versions are further prohibited from misrepresentative use of the
 Zip-Bugs or Info-ZIP e-mail addresses or the Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to
 imply Info-ZIP will provide support for the altered versions.
