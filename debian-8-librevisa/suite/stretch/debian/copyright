 These files are taken verbatim from the specification document and contain
 interface definitions only.
Comment:
 The VISA working group within IVI has been contacted asking for
 clarification on the status of these documents; so far, without answer.
 .
 Given that these files contain interface definitions only (which are
 widely regarded uncopyrightable), several other vendors ship these files
 almost verbatim and it is generally in the best interest of
 interoperability to use consistent definitions, using these files appears
 to be the best option.
