cython (0.19.1+git34-gac3e3a2-1~bpo70+1) wheezy-backports; urgency=low

  This version of cython may cause packages within the wheezy archive
  to fail to build from source if it is installed.

  It should only be used if you need a newer cython than that in wheezy
  and are aware of the risks. Probably an isolated build environment/chroot
  is the best way to use it safely.
