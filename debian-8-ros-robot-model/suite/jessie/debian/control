Description: Development files for ROS collada_parser library
 This package contains a C++ parser for the Collada robot description format.
 The parser reads a Collada XML robot description, and creates a C++ URDF
 model. Although it is possible to directly use this parser when working with
 Collada robot descriptions, the preferred user API is found in the urdf
 package.
 .
 This package contains the development files for the library.
